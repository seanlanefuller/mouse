Mouse is a computer programming language that was designed by Peter Grogono.  It was originally documented in an article in the July 1979 issue of BYTE Magazine.  It evolved into a book called "MOUSE: A Language for Microcomputers" that was published in February 1983.  This project is for maintaining compilers, interpreters, debuggers, development tools, and documentation for the language.
